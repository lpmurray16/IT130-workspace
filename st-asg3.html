        <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Born in Auburn Hills, MI in 1995 I was about a year old when we moved
          to Cary, IL. I have two sisters, one older, and one younger. Being the
          middle child between two girls is just as wild as it sounds. But I
          usually kept to myself and never fought much with them (mostly because
          I never needed to borrow any clothes).

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
          Graduated from Cary-Grove High School in 2014. I thought I wanted to
          be a Nurse so I decided to go to the University of Iowa.
