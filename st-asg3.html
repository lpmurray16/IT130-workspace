            <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Born in Auburn Hills, MI in 1995 about a year went by before we moved to hometown of Cary, IL. I have
                two sisters, Haylee the oldest, and Maia the youngest. Being the middle child between two girls is just
                as wild as it sounds. But I usually kept to myself
                and never fought much with them (mostly because I never needed to borrow any clothes). I currently live
                in Crystal Lake, IL which is a hell of a train ride to school, but I am almost done with my degree and I
                am excited for what comes
                next.

                I graduated from Cary-Grove High School in 2014. I thought I wanted to be a Nurse so I decided to go to
                the University of Iowa to study Nursing. After volunteering at the hospital on campus I quickly realized
                that this career path was NOT for me. I then
                went to a community college in AZ for a year before deciding that I wanted to pursue a career in
                Computer Science! I have been at DePaul ever since.

            <p>
                In my free time I enjoy playing video games and working on my coding projects. I am currently trying to
                learn the React JS Framework. I love spending time with my friends and just tossing a baseball or
                football around. With work and school and God knows
                what else, I really cherish my free-time.
