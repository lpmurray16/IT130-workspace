      <h2>Favorite Book</h2>
      <p>
        When I was first learning how to read I started with easy Books just like any other kid. But then my mother
        suggested that I challenge myself and read a "big kid" book with chapters and everything and that book was Harry
        Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.
        I instantly fell in love with the series and this was my favorite one to read. I've read it 8 times and it never
        fails to keep me entertained. The series in general has a strong influence on my life and personality. It
        is just one of those things that you grow alongside with.
